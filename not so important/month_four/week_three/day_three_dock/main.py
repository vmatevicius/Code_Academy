# Google is launching a network of autonomous pizza delivery drones
# and wants you to create a flexible rewards system (Pizza Pointsâ„¢)
# that can be tweaked in the future.
# The rules are simple: if a customer has made at least N orders of at least Y price,
# they get a FREE pizza! Create a function that takes a dictionary of customers,
# a minimum number of orders and a minimum order price. Return a list of customers that are eligible for a free pizza.
