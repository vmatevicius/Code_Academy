# Phase 1:
#     Create a class that would represent pc parts.
#     It should contain basic methods to retreive items name, price, colour (if applicable).
#     PC part list can be found here: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/
#     The every separate part should have at least 3-4 methods to gather this part specific data (example: CPU - brand , speed, power usuage etc.)
#     At this stage, dictionary data structures can work as Database.
#     OOP abstraction, inheritance and encapsulation must be presented in a code base.
#     Unit tests must be written for the methods.
